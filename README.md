<h3 align="center">Computer Vision Framework for Domino Chain Motion Capture</h3>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

## Original Design Document

**Formal Expirement report**:
Domino chain effect is a complex, marginally stabilized multi-body dynamics system. While various models have been proposed and evaluated, but have not yet converged to satisfactory results. This repository presents a new methodology with high-speed camera and computer vision for precise domino block's motion capture. Key steps include optimized recording conditions, video preprocessing, edge detection, and reconstruction
