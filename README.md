<h1 align="center">Computer Vision Framework for Domino Chain Motion Capture</h1>

## About The Project

Domino chain effect is a complex, marginally stabilized multi-body dynamics system. While various models have been proposed and evaluated, but have not yet converged to satisfactory results. This repository presents a new methodology with high-speed camera and computer vision for precise domino block's motion capture. Key steps include optimized recording conditions, video preprocessing, edge detection, and reconstruction.

The framework has been tested across various setups and demonstrated reliable results in accurately acquiring the angular position and velocity of each individual domino block through instantaneous detection.
